# memset

In this homework assignment you will write a function called `memset` to fill up an array with a given value. Your function will take three parameters as inputs:

1. The base address of the array in R0
2. The value to put in each byte of the array in R1
3. The length of the array in R2

You should also write a `main` function and test your implementation of `memset` with some different inputs to make sure they work. You can test by filling up your array with an ASCII character (say 'N') and then print the array out with `puts`.

## Grading

We will call your function with a few different combinations of inputs to see if it fills the correct value the correct number of times.
